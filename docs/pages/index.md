# PHP Goodness

PHP is a great programming language with a fascinating history and a massive 
impact on web development.

This website's current content is just a placeholder and I will be posting new 
content here in the future. The project aims to highlight PHP's good parts, 
modern approaches to PHP development, and its ecosystem. It also seeks to 
respond to some of the language critiques.
